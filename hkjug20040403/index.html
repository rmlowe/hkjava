<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Biography</b><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ben got his Ph.D. degree 
  in engineering from Iowa State University specializing in high-speed and parallel 
  computation. After graduation, he has worked as a Research Scientist doing high-speed 
  computation for NASA. Since 1997, he has worked for various startups in Silicon 
  Valley, California, both as developer and manager in fileds such as engineering 
  simulations, VoIP telecom, mobile Internet solutions, and network management. 
  Ben came across JBoss in one of his previous work when he was looking for an 
  alternative J2EE application server. He was hooked immediately to the beauty 
  of the architecture. He joined the JBoss, Inc. on November 2003 after working 
  as a open-source contributor for a while. Currently he is working on JBossCache 
  and Clustering. He is the co-authors of the JBossCache, an open-source, transactional 
  and replicated cache that can be used either inside JBoss application server, 
  or as a standalone product. Details of JBossCache can be found here (<a href="http://www.jboss.org/developers/projects/jboss/cache/index.html">http://www.jboss.org/developers/projects/jboss/cache/index.html</a>). 
  Besides developing the latest features for JBossCache, he also spends time teaching 
  and consulting on J2EE/JBoss for enterprises.<br>

  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">JBoss is currently the 
  premier open-soruce J2EE application server on the market. In this talk, we 
  will cover both the business side of JBoss on what makes it popular, and the 
  underlying architecture of the JBoss. Next, we will focus on the open-source 
  development model using JBoss as an example. We will examine the JBoss model 
  and see how it operates. Topics of development process such as architecting, 
  code management, QA and release processes will be discussed in details. We will 
  look at how JBoss implements its mcro-kernel based on JMX to enable flexibility. 
  We will define AOP (aspect-oriented programming) and discuss its implementation 
  in the JBoss application server, showing how a microkernel combined with simple 
  AOP technology can enable the creation of generalized containers. From small 
  single purpose embedded controls to large enterprise systems, JBoss middleware 
  enables easy system assembly by AOP and aspects. Finally, the JBoss' supported 
  open-soruce projects such as Tomcat, Hibernate, JGroups, JBossCache, and Nukes 
  will be discussed.</font></p>
