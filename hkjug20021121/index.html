<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Technology transfer is 
  a process in putting an innovation output from a university or research centre 
  to the market. This is a complex process and is often hindered by many barriers. 
  In this presentation, the technology transfer model will be introduced. In addition, 
  methods to improcess technology transfer efficiency will be discussed. Moreover, 
  difefrent incentive schemes offered by the HKSAR Government will be presented.</font></p>
