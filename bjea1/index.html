<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The subtitle of the first 
  volume in the <i>Building Java Enterprise Applications</i> series is somewhat 
  misleading. The book focuses on implementing the data storage and business rules 
  of an enterprise system, with discussion of building a web interface deferred 
  to Volume II. (Volume III will focus on Web services.) Calling this &quot;architecture&quot; 
  implies that an enterprise architect need not be concerned with user interfaces 
  to enterprise systems, which makes about as much sense as saying that the architect 
  of a house need not be concerned with the external appearance of the building 
  he designs. Architects take note: this book is about the foundations, not the 
  fa&ccedil;ade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">O'Reilly books are typically 
  stronger on practical &quot;how-to&quot; advice than theoretical discussion, 
  and this one is no exception. The text is packed with SQL scripts, code examples 
  and deployment descriptors, and is not for those who don't like to get their 
  hands dirty. On the other hand, discussions of more abstract topics tend to 
  be exercises in vagueness and hand-waving. For example, while object-orientation 
  and design patterns are both given lip-service, there is little substance; in 
  particular, one section, in which the author seems to imply that <i>encapsulation</i> 
  (a fundamental principle behind object-oriented techniques) is essentially an 
  obfuscation mechanism designed to improve security, could be enough to make 
  object-oriented purists weep.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Throughout the book the 
  author develops a single example system, the back-end for an online brokerage. 
  This gives the book consistency; disappointingly, however, he spends little 
  time considering alternative approaches to the one developed; in particular, 
  the utility of Enterprise JavaBeans, on which the system depends, is never questioned 
  at all. The design that is developed is a particularly 'heavy' one, in which 
  each entity in the system is implemented by an entity bean, one or more value 
  objects, and a session bean to 'manage' the entity. Taking into account remote, 
  local, home and local home interfaces for both entity and session beans, this 
  can easily lead to a dozen or so classes for even the simplest of entities, 
  without even touching the business rules! While that development overhead might 
  be justified for some applications, it wouldn't hurt to present some more lightweight 
  alternatives, and to consider the pros and cons of each design.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This book is less impressive 
  than the author's XML books (<a href="../javaxml2/index.html">Java &amp; XML</a>; 
  <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/javaxmldatabind/">Java &amp; XML Data 
  Binding</a>). Those looking for an introduction to J2EE would be better off 
  with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201787903/qid=1027079848/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-1066937-3232961">Designing 
  Enterprise Applications with the J2EE(TM) Platform, Second Edition</a>, published 
  by Addison-Wesley; those looking specifically for an introduction to Enterprise 
  JavaBeans should pick up O'Reilly's <a href="../ejb/index.html">Enterprise JavaBeans</a> 
  by Richard Monson-Haefel. However, for those who are prepared to read around 
  and absorb many different perspectives on enterprise Java development, <i>Building 
  Java Enterprise Applications Volume I</i> is worth a look.</font></p>
