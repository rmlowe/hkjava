  the ColdFusion MX architecture, you have to peel back the layers of
  technology. The primary way developers experience ColdFusion is through our
  scripting languages. Developers work in CFML and access the capabilities of
  the server through its intuitive tags.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Also part of the
  server are the built-in application services. With ColdFusion 5, we added our
  charting engine, which has been significantly enhanced in this release, and
  we’ve long included an embedded version of Verity’s industry-leading search
  technology. With this release, we’ve added two new application services: The
  Flash Remoting Service provides an optimized connection between the
  ColdFusion server and the Flash Player. This connection enables users to
  build rich client applications that access ColdFusion resources. We’ve also
  included a web services engine that allows you to invoke and create web
  services. As with the other application services, the web services and Flash
  Remoting are accessible through easy-to-use tags that are part of the ColdFusion
  scripting environment.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The
  revolutionary part of this release is that we’ve implemented this powerful
  environment on top of an embedded J2EE 1.3 compliant Java application server
  based on JRun technology. So ColdFusion MX is a Java-based application that
  runs on the Java platform. As you probably know, JRun is a very successful
  J2EE. But in order to use JRun you have to know how to program in Java and
  learn the J2EE APIs. As a result, it’s only accessible to a limited range of
  developers. By embedding this powerful platforms within the approachable and
  productive ColdFusion environment, we’re making it accessible to a much
  broader group of business application developers.</font><br>
