<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In January 2002, Sunny 
  Lun of Macromedia showed the Hong Kong Java User Group how to use Flash Generator 
  to dynamically create Flash content from a Java servlet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Things change fast in the 
  tech world, and in the first half of 2002 Macromedia revamped practically all 
  of its product offerings under the 'MX' banner. With MX, Macromedia seems to 
  be trying to position their products as a complete client-server solution for 
  the Web, and in Flash MX the emphasis has shifted from 'generation' (a content-oriented 
  approach, not ideal for highly interactive applications as it could lead to 
  heavy bandwidth usage) to 'remoting,' in which a Flash client talks to server-side 
  components such as session beans using a firewall-friendly, HTTP-based protocol. 
  The application server can be Macromedia's own ColdFusion MX or JRun 4. Macromedia 
  plans shortly to release components that will allow other application servers, 
  based on J2EE or Microsoft's .NET, to use Flash remoting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It looks as if Macromedia 
  is hoping that Flash MX can succeed where Java applets have, so far, largely 
  failed&#151;as a universal rich client for the Web. The case has some merit&#151;not 
  only does Flash boast rich development tools that are oriented towards designers 
  and user interface experts, but it could prove easier to deploy. Macromedia 
  claims that something like 98 per cent of Web clients are Flash-enabled, although 
  the figure for Flash 6, the only version that supports remoting, is substantially 
  lower.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On the server side, ColdFusion 
  MX has been re-engineered to run on J2EE, which means much tighter integration 
  with the Java language that in previous versions, while JRun 4 is compatible 
  with J2EE 1.3, supports XDoclet, uses a JMX service-based archiecture and Jini-based 
  clustering, and offers Web services support. However, while Flash remoting uses 
  an HTTP-based protocol, it is not SOAP, and connecting Flash to a Web service 
  requires going through Macromedia's proprietary middleware. When asked whether 
  future versions of Flash will support the ability to access Web services directly, 
  Sunny was doubtful. This position is perhaps not surprising given that Macromedia 
  gives away the Flash player and makes money from middleware; however, the industry 
  seems to be moving rapidly towards SOAP, and in the face of increasing competition 
  from Web-service enabled Java and .NET clients, it will be interesting to see 
  for how long Macromedia can sustain this position.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With the MX product line, 
  integrating Flash clients with J2EE becomes a real possibility, and the combination 
  promises to be a powerful one. As usual, application architects will need to 
  weigh the benefits against the drawbacks of using proprietary technologies.</font></p>
