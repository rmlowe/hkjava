<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Abstract</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There has been a lot of 
  hype about how Web services will be used. This talk introduces Web services 
  from a practical level, how they're being used today by real customers for EAI 
  and B2B, and how Web services fits emerging technologies like grid computing 
  and connecting wireless devices. The focus is on business and technical value 
  of using Web services technologies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We'll start by discussing 
  the problems in EAI and B2B integration, then gives a brief architectural introduction 
  to the technologies, including the newest ideas like WS-I.org and WS-Security. 
  Next we talk about using Web services, and present customer stories on actual 
  Web Services implementations. The talk includes a brief presentation of the 
  IBM strategy for Web services, including our work with standards, open source, 
  products, and how we work with customers. We'll have a look at a few customer 
  case studies. Last, we'll talk about trends and directions, including uses for 
  Web services beyond EAI and B2B integration.<br>
