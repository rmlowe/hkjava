  Enterprise Systems with J2EE 1.3</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Eddie Chui, <a href="http://www.bea.com/">BEA 
  Systems</a></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Eddie's presentation focused 
  on the J2EE Connector Architecture. Since we can't usually rewrite existing 
  applications in Java, it is often necessary to integrate with non-Java systems. 
  The JCA attempts to ease the burden of integration by providing a standard mechanism 
  for Java clients to connect to Enterprise Information Systems. Version 1.0 of 
  the JCA was included in the J2EE platform for the first time in J2EE 1.3. Version 
  1.5 of the JCA is currently in development.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Under the JCA, an Enterprise 
  Information System (for example, an Enterprise Resource Planning System, a database, 
  or a transaction processing system) provides a <i>resource adapter</i> that 
  can be plugged into any application server that supports JCA. A resource adapter 
  consists of a JAR file with the filename extension <i>.rar</i>, which contains 
  the resource adapter classes and other JARs, in addition to a deployment descriptor 
  (named <i>ra.xml</i>) and, in some cases, native libraries required by the adapter. 
  A resource adapter can be used in both <i>managed environments</i> (i.e. in 
  an application server) and <i>nonmanaged environments</i> (such as in a two-tier 
  application). A resource adapter talks to an application server through the 
  <i>service provider interface</i> (SPI).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The JCA specifies three 
  <i>system contracts</i> that a resource adapter must implement, for connection 
  management, transaction management, and security respectively. In the case of 
  connection management, the adapter provides a <i>connection factory</i> that 
  creates connections. In a managed environment, the application server will typically 
  support pooling of connections by providing a <i>connection manager</i>. A resource 
  adapter can implement a <i>connection event listener</i> to be notified of connection-related 
  events such as transaction commits and rollbacks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The transaction management 
  contracts allow for two types of transactions: <i>local transactions</i>, which 
  are limited in scope to the adapter's particular EIS, and <i>distributed transactions</i>, 
  which are coordinated by an external transaction manager (typically provided 
  by the application server) and may span multiple systems. Distributed transactions 
  make use of the <i>Java Transaction API</i> (JTA), which is a Java mapping of 
  the X/Open transaction model and uses a two-phase commit protocol to coordinate 
  transactions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There was an interesting 
  discussion about using the JCA with custom mainframe applications such as those 
  used by many banks. Daniel DesRosiers pointed out that, in reality, most of 
  these custom applications don't support distributed transactions in any meaningful 
  way. Eddie suggested that, in these situations, a JCA adapter might bypass the 
  service layer and access the application's data source directly. However, in 
  situations where it is hard to work with the data source directly, a pure-Java 
  solution such as the JCA might not be workable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The security contracts 
  deal with authentication and authorisation, and support both <i>container-managed</i> 
  and <i>component-managed</i> sign-on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The <i>Common Client Interface</i> 
  (CCI) provides a standardised interface that clients can use to pull data from 
  the EIS, roughly equivalent to the interfaces provided by JDBC for accessing 
  relational databases. The CCI is optional in JCA 1.0, but compulsory in the 
  forthcoming JCA 1.5.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Eddie pointed out a few 
  limitations of the JCA. The current version does not support asynchronous, message-oriented 
  communication (although this might be addressed in version 2.0.), nor does it 
  support callbacks or address workflow. Finally, there is a lack of visual tools 
  for data mapping.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Comparing the JCA to Web 
  services, Eddie pointed out that legacy systems often cannot be extended to 
  support Web services, whereas a JCA adapter can be designed to communicate with 
  such systems using their existing custom protocols. Also, Web services are still 
  lacking standard models for transactions and security. On the other hand, a 
  Web service will support a wider range of clients than a JCA adapter, which 
  supports only Java clients. Also, Web services are designed to work over the 
  public Internet, so connectivity is extremely cheap. Finally, a hybrid solution 
  is entirely possible; a JCA resource adapter could provide a convenient API 
  to Java clients, while using a Web service at the network level to communicate 
  with the EIS.</font></p>
