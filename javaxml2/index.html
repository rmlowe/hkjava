<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>Unlike the first edition, 
the second edition of <I>Java &amp; XML</I> does not attempt to provide a 
thorough introduction to XML. In fact, there is only a single chapter on XML 
itself. Therefore, if you're looking for a thorough explanation of XML Schema or 
XSLT, look elsewhere. This book is focused squarely on Java APIs for XML, and 
Java applications that make use of XML.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>After the brief coverage 
  of XML basics, the book divides neatly into two parts. Chapters three through 
  nine cover the most popular Java APIs for working with XML: SAX, DOM, JDOM, 
  and JAXP. In general, this is solid stuff. The pros and cons of the various 
  APIs are clearly explained, and there are plently of detailed code examples. 
  The book covers SAX 2.0 and DOM Level 2. There are chapters on advanced topics 
  for each of SAX, DOM and JDOM, covering topics such as SAX filters, and the 
  DOM Level 2 modules. The author is one of the founders (along with <A 
href="../jservlet2/index.html">Java Servlet Programming</A> author Jason Hunter) 
  of the JDOM project, and so is particularly knowledgeable on this subject.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>Chapters ten through 
fifteen cover specfic applications of Java and XML. In particular, the chapter 
on Web Publishing Frameworks provides the best coverage of the Cocoon framework 
you are likely to find. Another chapter on Content Syndication discusses using 
XML to share content between web sites, including the use of Rich Site Summary 
(RSS) channels. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The biggest problem with 
the book—and this is in no way the fault of the author or publisher—comes when 
dealing with cutting-edge topics such as Web services and data binding. The 
problem is simply that the technologies in these spaces are changing so fast 
that, just over a year after publication, the chapters on these topics are 
already seriously dated. For example, the code in the chapters on Web services 
is based on Apache SOAP rather than Apache Axis, because at the time of writing 
Axis was at a pre-alpha stage. (Axis, the successor of Apache SOAP, has since 
produced a 1.0 release.) Nor do these chapters mention the slew of Java Web 
services specifications that have come out of the JCP in the past year or so: 
JAXM, JAXR, JAX-RPC, SAAJ. Similarly, the JAXB examples in the chapter on data 
binding are based on version 0.21 of the JAXB specification; the specification 
has since been almost entirely rewritten.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The final chapter looks 
ahead at some up-and-coming technologies such as XLink and XPointer. Overall, if 
you need to process XML using Java and are looking for somewhere to get started, 
this book is a good bet, although you might do well to get hold of another book 
on "pure" XML topics. It's also an excellent introduction to Cocoon. If you're 
looking for material on Web services or data binding, you might still find 
<I>Java &amp; XML</I> helpful—but be prepared to supplement it with plently of 
reading on the Web to bring yourself up-to-date on the most recent 
developments.</FONT></P>
