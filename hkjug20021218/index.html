<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>About the JESSICA2 Talk</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In this talk, Dr. Wang 
  will present a new distributed Java virtual machine, named JESSICA2, based on 
  their previous project JESSICA (&quot;Java-Enabled Single-System-Image Computing 
  Architecture&quot;) to support parallel execution of multithreaded Java applications 
  in a networked cluster environment. JESSICA2 is implemented as a middleware 
  at the virtual machine level that makes a cluster of PCs/workstations appear 
  as a single, multi-processor machine to Java applications. With JESSICA2, users 
  can launch any multithreaded Java application onto the cluster without modification 
  of its Java code. JESSICA2 supports runtime Java thread migration by performing 
  dynamic native code instrumentation inside the JIT compiler. Java threads can 
  freely move across node boundaries and execute in parallel to achieve more scalable 
  computing using clusters. With the new JIT compiler and thread migration support, 
  Java threads that are executing computation hotspots can be migrated to other 
  nodes to achieve more effective load balancing. Performance results obtained 
  from the recently built 300-node PC cluster (HKU &quot;Gideon 300&quot;, now 
  ranked 175th in the world's TOP500 supercomputer list) will be discussed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dr. Cho-Li Wang received 
  his B.S. degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering from National 
  Taiwan University in 1985. He obtained his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer 
  Engineering from University of Southern California in 1990 and 1995 respectively. 
  He is currently an associative professor with the Department of Computer Science 
  and Information Systems at The University of Hong Kong. His research interests 
  are in Cluster and Grid Computing. He is a member of the executive committee
