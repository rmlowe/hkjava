<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michael Leung has been 
  working hard to promote .NET--he told the audience at the Hong Kong Java User 
  Group's June 2001 meeting that he had given 50 presentations on the subject 
  in the preceding 6 months. Microsoft has certainly been in the vanguard of the 
  web services movement, popularising the idea of service-oriented components 
  that communicate over the Internet using open standards like SOAP, WDSL and 
  UDDI, and that are accessible from a wide range of smart devices. In fact, with 
  .NET Microsoft is betting big-time on the widespread adoption of these standards. 
  Despite some shortcomings--performance issues, compatibility<br>
  issues, and relatively primitive semantics compared with, say, CORBA--this looks 
  like a fairly safe bet with big players like IBM, HP and Sun expressing support.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So with all these open 
  standards, what's special about .NET? According to Michael, the answer lies 
  in something Microsoft has traditionally done well: rapid application development 
  tools that hide the underlying complexity of the platform and flatten the learning 
  curve for developers. We saw some impressive demos of a beta version of Visual 
  Studio.Net, the flagship development tool for .NET; for example, a class written 
  in one language (C#) inheriting from a class written in another (Visual Basic). 
  (In an obvious jab at Java, Microsoft is touting the &quot;language-independence&quot;of 
  .NET, although some might question the wisdom of cross-language development 
  efforts.) In another example, we were shown a web-based application being developed 
  using the same event-driven paradigm that tools like Visual Basic and Delphi 
  brought to Windows programming a decade of so back. A third example demonstrated 
  how to turn a standard method into a web service using a single keyword.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's easy to imagine this 
  appealing to overstretched IT departments that might struggle to find developers 
  experienced with J2EE or CORBA. Will we see .NET ported to platforms other than 
  Windows? The answer seems to be, &quot;Don't hold your breath.&quot; The bottom 
  line: expect Visual Studio.Net to be a killer web services development tool, 
  for those content to develop only for the Windows platform.</font></p>
