<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>Although there are plently 
of introductory books on Java servlet technology, <I>Java Servlet 
Programming</I> stands out from the crowd by combining solid, comprehensive 
coverage of the basics with more advanced but highly useful material that few 
similar books offer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The basics are dealt with 
in chapters one through five, which offer a brief history of Web applications 
(from the era of CGI and Perl), an introduction to HTTP and servlets, an 
explanation of servlet configuration and the servlet lifecycle, plus two 
detailed chapters on working with the HTTP request and response objects 
respectively. There is also a separate chapter on sending non-HTML content, and 
another on working with cookies and sessions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The highlight of the second 
edition, and the aspect that most sets Java Servlet Programming apart from other 
books, is the in-depth discussion of content-generation technologies. Here, the 
authors go beyond the core servlet API, and devotes no less than five chapters 
to freely-available add-ons that ease the task of generating web pages, 
typically HTML. Although Sun's JavaServer Pages is currently the most popular 
servlet-based presentation technology, it is by no means the only solution, and 
the authors make a strong case that it is not always the best. In addition to 
JSP, there are chapters on the Tea framework, WebMacro, the Element Construction 
Set, and Enhydra's XMLC. While each of these technologies has its own strengths 
and weaknesses, each aims to provides a way to generate output that is superior 
to <CODE>out.println</CODE> in terms of maintainability, reuse and so forth. The 
authors stop short of discussing full-blown MVC frameworks such as Struts, but 
that's understandable since the extra material would probably have turned the 
book, already close to 800 pages, into a two-volume set.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>Another highlight is the 
chapter on applet-servlet communication. While neither applets nor servlets are 
particularly hard to develop in themselves, building a system that coordinates 
the two is not trivial, and stumps plenty of programmers who are new to 
developing Web-based applications with Java. This chapter actually discusses 
three ways of getting an applet to talk to a server, namely low-level sockets, 
HTTP, and RMI, of which only HTTP actually requires the use of servlets. In 
addition to plentiful example code, the pros and cons of the different 
approaches are laid out clearly. This is a very useful treatment of a topic that 
few books on servlets discuss.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The book also includes 
excellent chapters on security, database-driven web applications, the role of 
servlets in J2EE (including a very good introduction to clustering concepts), 
and internationalization.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>As usual with O'Reilly, 
there are plently of code examples. The style of the book is very down-to-earth 
and practical, and the authors clearly know their stuff. The five chapters on 
content generation alone make this book a must-have for servlet developers. If 
that includes you, get a copy, even if you have to sell your granny.</FONT></P>
