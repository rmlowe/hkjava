<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Enterprise JavaBeans</i>, 
  by Richard Monson-Haefel, covers versions 2.0 and 1.1 of the Enterprise JavaBeans 
  specification. (Version 1.0, covered in previous editions of the book, has been 
  dropped, which is no great loss.) In an excellent introductory chapter, the 
  book describes the background of EJB as the convergence of two technologies: 
  transaction monitors (such as CICS and TUXEDO); and distibuted object technologies 
  (such as CORBA and Java RMI). Subsequent chapters go on to describe the high-level 
  architecture and primary services (resource management, location transparency, 
  security, transactions, persistence) of EJB. These initial chapters are quite 
  theoretical, but this is as it should be; the ideas that underlie EJB are not 
  trivial, and are unlikely to be well understood simply by diving straight into 
  code examples.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After the initial three 
  chapters, there is plenty of code. The author develops a single example throughout 
  (that of a cruise business), which lends the book a nice consistency. Unfortunately, 
  some of the code examples are rather clumsy (for example, using an exception 
  as a signal to break out of a loop), but this doesn't detract much from the 
  clarity of the ideas being developed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Arguably the core of the 
  book is its extremely comprehensive coverage of EJB 2.0's <i>container-managed 
  persistence</i> (CMP), to which three substantial chapters are devoted. This 
  is not overkill; it's a complex topic, and the detailed coverage is much needed. 
  There is also a single chapter on EJB 1.1's much simpler version of CMP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The book devotes an entire 
  chapter to the subject of transactions, again an abstract and difficult topic 
  that is presented with clarity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Message-driven beans, the 
  other major addition to EJB 2.0 along with the new CMP model, is also dealt 
  with thoroughly. (The author has also co-authored <a href="../javmesser/index.html">another 
  book</a> on the Java Message Service, the technology that underlies message-driven 
  beans.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Although the book does 
  not attempt to cover advanced design strategies (rightly so, as this topic would 
  take several books by itself), a chapter on <i>Design Strategies</i> explains 
  a few of the most important techniques such as <i>value objects</i> and <i>business 
  interfaces</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Finally, there is a detailed 
  chapter on XML deployment descriptor files, and another that explains how EJBs 
  fit into the &quot;big picture&quot; of the Java 2, Enterprise Edition platform.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Overall, this is an excellent 
  book for anyone with solid Java skills and a working knowledge of SQL, who wants 
  to acquire a thorough understanding of Enterprise JavaBeans.</font></p>
