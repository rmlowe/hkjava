<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dr. S.C. Cheung gave an 
  entertaining and informative introduction to Enterprise JavaBeans at the May 
  2001 meeting of the Hong Kong Java User Group. As well as providing an overview 
  of the technical features of EJB (lifecycle management, security, transactions 
  and so forth) along with code examples, S.C. gave us some useful insights into 
  the software development process and the relevance of component-based architectures. 
  He started off by posing the question &quot;What is a component?&quot; and argued 
  that trends in software engineering--from Fortran and GOTO, to structured programming 
  and procedures, to object-oriented and component-based programming--all address 
  one fundamental problem, that of managing the complexity of software projects, 
  by applying ever-greater discipline to the software development process. According 
  to S.C., the essential difference between components and classes is that component-based 
  architectures aim to minimize dependencies between components, hence making 
  components more reusable than classes. He defined a component as &quot;a deployment 
  unit that provides a business service to its clients&quot;, and outlined four 
  factors for successful component reuse: packaging, integration, legacy support 
  (the audience enjoyed S.C.'s definition of legacy systems as &quot;systems that 
  work&quot;), and robustness. While acknowledging that J2EE and EJB are very 
  marketable skills for developers, S.C. stressed that EJBs are not necessarily 
  the right solution for every project. He made the interesting point that, rather 
  than rushing to use EJBs, we might do better to study the underlying design 
  patterns of the EJB architecture and figure out how to apply those patterns 
  to our own projects. In other words, EJB is optional, but design patterns are 
  a must.</font></p>
