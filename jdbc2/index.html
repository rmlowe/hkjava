<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>"A different kind of 
animal" was the one-time tagline of O'Reilly &amp; Associates. Whoever at 
O'Reilly came up with that slogan had undoubtedly just browsed a copy of 
<I>Database Programming with JDBC™ and Java™</I>. The book is indeed a different 
kind of animal—specifically, a rather bizarre two-headed creature. As you would 
imagine, this poor beast tends to be rather confused about where it is going and 
whom it is facing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The first half of the book 
focuses, not surprisingly, on the core JDBC APIs, including a brief ten-page 
chapter on the basic concepts of relational databases and SQL. Chapter 3 
introduces the basic JDBC classes and interfaces—how to obtain a <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Connection<FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </FONT></FONT>from a <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier, mono">DriverManager</FONT>; using <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Statement</FONT> objects to execute queries 
and updates; using <FONT face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ResultSet</FONT> 
objects to examine the results of a query. It also discusses the mapping between 
SQL datatypes and Java datatypes. Chapter 4 covers the use of <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier, mono">PreparedStatement</FONT>s to execute 
precompiled SQL, and <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CallableStatement</FONT>s for stored 
procedures, as well as other more esoteric issues: the batch processing APIs, 
advanced datatypes including <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier, mono">BLOB</FONT>s and <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CLOB</FONT>s, and meta-data. Chapter 5 covers 
the JDBC 2.0 Optional Package, which is an important part of the J2EE platform. 
This includes the <FONT face="Courier New, Courier, mono">DataSource</FONT> 
interface (which replaces <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier, mono">DriverManager</FONT> as the preferred way to 
obtain database connections), support for connection pooling, the <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier, mono">RowSet</FONT> interface, and support for 
distributed transactions (that is, transactions that involve more than one 
database).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>While there are few 
examples, at least by O'Reilly standards, the first part of the book provides a 
fairly complete overview of the JDBC APIs. At this point, however, the book 
takes an unexpected turn. After spending a chapter discussing various other Java 
enterprise technologies (JNDI, RMI, object serialization, EJB), the author 
proceeds to spend four chapters developing, at least in outline, a complete 
distributed component framework. This is an ambitious and challenging project, 
but seems entirely out of place in an introductory book on JDBC. Instead of 
describing EJB in detail (in any case, not what the book is supposed to be 
about), the author effectively reinvents it. Thus, chapter 7 focuses on 
architectural issues and design patterns, while chapter 8 discusses the 
non-persistence aspects of the framework, including security and transactions. 
Chapter 9 focuses on the actual persistence framework, and is the only chapter 
in this half of the book that actually makes use of JDBC. Chapter 10 describes a 
client application with a graphical user interface based on Swing. The example 
used throughout these chapters is that of a banking application. Of course, in a 
little over a hundred pages the author is able only to scratch the surface of 
issues such as transaction monitors, instance pooling, relationship mapping and 
so forth.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>There's nothing 
particularly wrong with the material in <I>Database Programming</I>—it's just 
difficult to know who the intended audience is. Readers new to JDBC will 
probably do better with a book that provides more introductory examples, while 
those with a serious interest in Java distributed component models are unlikely 
to require a JDBC tutorial. If, however, you are a JDBC novice who dreams of 
writing your own EJB container from scratch, then good luck to you. This stange 
animal might well be the perfect companion for your journey.</FONT></P>
